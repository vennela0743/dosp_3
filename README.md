# project : Chord Protocol Implementation in Pony


## Team Members
- Chandan Abhishek Muchukota
- Vennela Priya Penumuchu
## What is Working
 - The basic Chord protocol functionality is working. This includes network join, finding successors, and routing messages. Each peer actor can successfully join the Chord ring and maintain its finger table, allowing efficient lookup. The average hop count is being calculated as required, and all nodes are able to handle their allotted requests per second, with results being displayed upon completion.

## What is the largest network you managed to deal with

- The largest network tested successfully involved X nodes and Y requests per node. Beyond this, the system experienced noticeable delays or exceeded resource limits. This size limit may vary based on system resources, but the network remained efficient and stable up to X nodes.
